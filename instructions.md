# Run Program
I am using port 5173 to run

## Fully working features
- full user authentication for login
- users can create accounts
- tutorials page is fully functioning, now calling the backend to fetch tutorials
- all 3rd party api calls moved to backend

## Not implemented
- search bars
- filters on patterns page (having a hard time getting ahold of details pattern info from api)

## Technically work, but not ideal
- Yarns page can fetch and filter yarns. But when api calls were moved to backend, it makes it way slower, even though it's using the same logic. I reduced number of items to fetch for the sake of quicker grading, but it makes for a smaller page currently. Due to complexity of the api as well as vague documentation, I need more time to figure out how to efficiently fetch/filter/get detailed info to display on frontend
